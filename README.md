Overloadr is a powerful web testing utility designed to simulate heavy traffic loads and stress-test websites to evaluate their performance and robustness under pressure. With a user-friendly interface, Overloadr gives developers and system administrators full control over the parameters of their tests, allowing for detailed and customizable stress scenarios.

Key Features:

 - Customizable Test Parameters: Adjust the number of threads, requests per second, and HTTP methods to tailor each test to your specific requirements. Simulate various real-world load conditions with precision.

 - Multiple Presets: Choose from a variety of preset configurations that provide a quick start to testing without having to manually adjust all settings. Ideal for rapid testing and benchmarking.

 - Advanced HTTP Methods: Support for multiple HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, enabling comprehensive testing of your web applicationâ€™s handling of different request types.

 - Statistics & Reporting: View real-time statistics, including time elapsed, total requests made, total errors encountered, and the number of active threads during the test. These metrics allow you to quickly gauge your website's performance under stress. Track key data points to identify potential issues, optimize server performance, and ensure your site can handle high traffic loads efficiently.

 - Scalability Testing: Simulate thousands of simultaneous users to ensure that your site can handle heavy traffic without compromising performance. Great for preparing for traffic spikes, product launches, or large marketing campaigns.
